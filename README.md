# ThirdEye
The code used for the Arduino Third Eye for the Blind Project is in the 2nd file named SwitcherTest.ino. It should be put into an Arduino IDE or another program that can tranfer code onto an Arduino. I originally made it for the Arduino Pro Micro, but it should work for other Arduino devices.

I also have a possible modification in which you can add a seven segment display to return the values that the ultrasonic sensor gets. Using a button, you can convert from inches to centimeters on the display. If interested, the code is in the file called ModificationCodeDisplay.ino
